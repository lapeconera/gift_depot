Our clients are online retailers who have a wide range of products and want to filter it to help customers find the best results according to their needs.
Our users are the people who want to save time looking for the match of their gift but want to give a good impression to the recipient who will receive the gift

Functionality:

With only little information of USER and the relationship of the person whoâ€™d receive the gift, we will narrow down the options and try to provide the best choice of all.

We selected the gift based on the value that we collected from 3 question:
Question1 ( Buyer's personality )
Through the coffee taste, we tried to track the personality of the user.
This is referenced from the article that analize the connection between the mind and the type of coffee we drink.
